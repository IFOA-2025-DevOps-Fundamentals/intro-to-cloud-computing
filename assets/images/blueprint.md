# Introduction to Cloud Computing

## Introduction: The Birth of the Internet and the Web
### From the Internet to the Cloud
To understand cloud computing, it is essential to start with the basics: the Internet.

- **1960s:** ARPANET, the first computer network, is born, laying the foundation for the Internet.
- **1980s:** The TCP/IP protocol is developed, allowing computers to communicate with each other on different networks.
- **1990s:** Tim Berners-Lee introduces the World Wide Web (WWW), enabling the spread of websites and online services.
- **2000s:** As fast, reliable Internet connections become increasingly available, companies begin to provide software and infrastructure as online services, giving rise to cloud computing.

### Internet as the Foundation of the Cloud
The Internet provides the connective tissue of cloud computing:
- It enables communication between devices and servers distributed around the world.
- It allows remote access to computational resources without the need for local hardware.
- It has enabled the development of web-based applications such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Office 365.

Cloud computing leverages this infrastructure to offer scalable and accessible services anywhere.

##Lesson Objectives
- Understand the concept of Cloud Computing
- Explore the main service and deployment models
- Analyze the advantages and challenges of the Cloud
- Introduce the concepts of Edge and Fog Computing
- Perform a short hands-on activity exploring a Cloud provider
- Discuss business use cases

##1. What is Cloud Computing?
Cloud Computing is a technological paradigm that allows on-demand access to computational resources over the Internet.

###Definition
"Computing may one day be organized as a public utility." - John McCarthy, MIT Centennial, 1961.

The cloud provides access to resources such as servers, storage, and applications without having to physically own them.

### Key Features
- **Scalability:** Resources can be increased or decreased based on demand.
- **Elasticity:** Ability to automatically adapt to changes in load.
- **Global Accessibility:** Services are available anywhere there is an Internet connection.
- **Pay-per-use pricing:** You only pay for the resources you use.

### Examples of Cloud Applications
Many everyday services use the cloud:
- **Video and music streaming:** Netflix, YouTube, Spotify
- **Social media and communication:** Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype
- **E-commerce:** Amazon, eBay
- **Enterprise services:** Google Drive, Dropbox, Office 365

**Discussion in class:** What services do you use daily that could be based on the cloud?

## 2. Cloud Service Models
### IaaS - Infrastructure as a Service
- Provides virtualized computing resources (servers, storage, networks).
- Examples: Amazon AWS, Google Compute Engine, Microsoft Azure.

### PaaS: Platform as a Service
- Environment for developing, testing, and deploying applications.
- Examples: Google App Engine, Heroku, Microsoft Azure App Services.

### SaaS: Software as a Service
- Applications accessible through a browser without local installation.
- Examples: Gmail, Google Drive, Dropbox, Microsoft Office 365.

## 3. Deployment Models
### Public Cloud
- Services provided by public providers and accessible by anyone.
- Examples: AWS, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure.

### Private Cloud
- Cloud infrastructure dedicated to a single organization.
- Greater control and security, but higher costs.

### Hybrid Cloud
- Combination of public and private cloud.
- Allows you to manage sensitive data in a private environment and leverage the public cloud for variable workloads.

**Exercise:** Discuss in small groups which cloud model is best suited to a company that wants to launch a new online service.

## 4. Edge and Fog Computing
One of the challenges of the cloud is **latency**: data has to travel to data centers, causing delays.

### Edge computing
- Process data close to the source (e.g. IoT devices, cameras, industrial sensors).
- Reduce latency and improve efficiency.

### Fog computing
- Extend cloud computing closer to users.
- Process data in distributed nodes before sending it to the central cloud.

**Use case:** A hospital wants to implement a real-time patient monitoring system. Which model between cloud, edge or fog would be more suitable?

##5. Advantages and Challenges of the Cloud
### Advantages
- **Flexibility:** Adaptable to business needs.
- **Cost reduction:** No physical infrastructure to manage.
- **Backup and Disaster Recovery:** Data automatically saved in multiple locations.
