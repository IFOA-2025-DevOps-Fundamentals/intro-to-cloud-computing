# What is Cloud Computing? 

Cloud Computing is a technological paradigm enabling on-demand access of computational resources through the internet. 
The internet acts as the foundational technology for the cloud, providing the connectivity tissue for cloud computing: 
- It enables communication between **devices** and **servers** distributed around the world.
- It allows **remote access** to **computational resources** without the need for local hardware.
- It has enabled the development of **web-based applications** such as Google Drive, Dropbox and Office 365.

Cloud computing leverages this infrastructure to offer scalable and accessible services anywhere.

## From the Internet to the Cloud

To understand cloud computing, it is essential to start with the basics: the ***Internet***.

- **1960s:** ARPANET, the **first computer network**, is born, laying the foundation for the Internet.
- **1980s:** The **TCP/IP protocol is developed**, allowing computers to communicate with each other on different networks.
- **1990s:** Tim Berners-Lee introduces the **World Wide Web** (WWW), enabling the spread of websites and online services.
- **2000s:** As fast, reliable Internet connections become increasingly available, companies begin to provide **software** and **infrastructure** as **online services**, giving rise to ***cloud computing***.

> [!NOTE]
>
> What is the difference between ***Internet*** and the ***World Wide Web***?

Internet and the WWW opened information systems to the world, ***literally***.

> [John McCarthy, MIT Centennial, 1961]: "Computing may someday be organized as a public utility"

> [Mark Weiser, Xerox PARC, 1996]"The most profound technologies are those that disappear. They weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it"

> [Steve Ballmer, CEO Microsoft, 2016]: "The cloud is the future, everything else is accessory"

As water, electricity and Gas, nowadays the Internet is a utility, almost a commodity. The actual and future solutions moved from past models technology delivery model to a service delivery model. 

> A **service** is the ability of a system (belonging to a **Service Provider**) of delivering continuously one or more responses in te presence of specific requests to the system by a customer, or **Service Requestor**. 

In this model, there is: 
- a ***customer***;
- a ***service provider***;
- a ***continuity factor*** that the service provider must guarantee (it introduces objective concepts as Service Level Agreement - SLA, or subjective concepts as reputations and trust).
